Please quit and reopen your R session and IDE (if you are using one, such as RStudio or Emacs) and check if tinytex:::is_tinytex() is TRUE.

Warning message:

Detected an existing LaTeX distribution (e.g., pdftex is at C:\Users\alona\AppData\Local\Programs\MIKTEX~1.9\miktex\bin\x64\pdftex.exe). 

You are recommended to uninstall it, although TinyTeX should work well alongside another LaTeX distribution if a LaTeX document is compiled through tinytex::latexmk().
